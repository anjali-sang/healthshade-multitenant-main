                information about our users (“users”, “You” and “Your”), we feel You should understand the terms
                and conditions surrounding the capture and use of that information. This Privacy Policy
                discloses what personal information we gather and how we use it.<br /><br />

                <b>General</b><br />
                Please note that “including”, the phrases “e.g.,” or “for example” and any derivatives of any of
                the foregoing mean “including, without limitation”; and the examples provided should not be
                considered to be all-inclusive or limiting.
                Our Privacy Policy applies to all of the products and services offered by Datacorns.
                Our Privacy Policy does not apply to products or services offered by, or the information
                practices of, other enterprises or individuals, including products or sites that may be
                displayed or offered to You in the use of our products, services and websites, or other websites
                linked to our services and websites (e.g. Shopify, Dymo, Quickbooks). You should theretofore
                review their policies to understand their practices before you link to, or transact business
                with, them through our services. We are not responsible or liable for such parties’ use of Your
                information.<br /><br />

                <b>Accessibility of Your Information – How You Control It</b><br />
                Our services, and in particular the Online Showroom feature of our IOSHIP Cloud™ Services, are
                designed so that users publish their product information online for their customers or public to
                see. Our services do not filter or monitor in respect of this.<br />
                You have control over, and You are responsible for, what information is accessible to other
                users of IOSHIP Cloud™ and the public. This is done via Your choices in the Online Showroom
                Settings of our services, and by specific actions that You take from time to time when using our
                services such as invoicing or adding users to Your account.<br />
                Be careful: Your use of our services can also result in making other information accessible to
                others which is not covered by the Online Showroom Settings as a result of actions that You
                take. For example, if You choose to allow Public Access to Your Online Showroom and choose to
                show the Pricing Information, then anyone on the Internet will be able to see Your products with
                their respective prices. When You add a user to Your account or You issue an invoice through our
                services, You are handling personal information and should ensure that You do so in compliance
                with applicable laws and regulations.
                Our Privacy Policy does not cover the information practices of other registered users of our
                products or services and their respective companies and organizations. Our products and services
                also enable you to exchange data with third party services, such as Shopify. You should review
                the data/information policies of other users and third party services before transacting
                business with them or interacting with them.<br />
                Please note that we reserve the right to change the Online Showroom Settings and their related
                default behavior within our services, but we will post notice of such changes on our affected
                website(s).<br /><br />

                information to a third party, we do not disclose personal information about an individual user
